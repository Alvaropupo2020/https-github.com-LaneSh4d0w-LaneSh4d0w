### You found me, congratulations !

Greetings young padawan, I'm Shadix, but I'm known by my diminutive "Shad".

I'm a polyvalent developer, aiming to discover and improve myself on many programmation languages (such as PHP with Symfony, and also C#).

My most notable projects were for the [@iptv-org](https://github.com/iptv-org) organisation, with [iptv-all](https://iptv-all.lanesh4d0w.codes) and [query-streamlink](https://github.com/LaneSh4d0w/query-streamlink), in which permitted to open new doors for making live streams available for everyone.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with Python.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently preparing something.
- ðŸ“« You can find me here or on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/theofficialomega), but if there's something you want to ask, just send an email at lanesh4d0w@gmail.com. (Do not send emails requesting stuff, when you can request them using the various repositories in which I operate. Do not also send me emails containing no subject / nothing in it nor weird stuff).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm stubborn (whoops !).
