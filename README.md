### You found me, congratulations !

Greetings young padawan, I'm Shadix, but I'm known by my diminutive "Shad".

I'm a polyvalent developer, aiming to discover and improve myself on many programmation languages (such as PHP with Symfony, and also C#).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with the C# and JS language.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently preparing something.
- ðŸ“« You can find me here, but if there's something you want to ask, just send an email at lanesh4d0w@gmail.com. (Do not send emails with nothing in it nor weird stuff).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm stubborn (whoops !).
