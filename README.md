### You found me, congratulations !

Greetings young padawan, I'm Shadix, but I'm known by my diminutive "Shad".

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with the C# language.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Oracle's PL/SQL.
- ðŸ“« You can find me here, but if there's something you want to ask, just PM me on Discord @ My5tic4l#3237.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm stubborn (whoops !).
